# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the Kiro Chess Battle III game to fully implement the geopolitical alliance system with special abilities, improve the game architecture with proper Django models, and add user management features. The current implementation has basic chess functionality but lacks the core alliance features that make this game unique, proper data persistence, and user account management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Alliance System Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to choose between NATO Alliance and Russian Alliance with unique special abilities, so that I can experience strategic gameplay beyond traditional chess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player starts a new game THEN the system SHALL present alliance selection (NATO vs Russian Alliance)
2. WHEN a player selects NATO Alliance THEN the system SHALL provide access to US Economic Sanctions, UK Special Forces, and France Diplomatic Retreat abilities
3. WHEN a player selects Russian Alliance THEN the system SHALL provide access to Russia Blitzkrieg, China Trade Negotiations, and North Korea Missile Strike abilities
4. WHEN a player uses Economic Sanctions THEN the system SHALL temporarily restrict opponent's available moves for one turn
5. WHEN a player uses Special Forces THEN the system SHALL allow an additional strategic move in the same turn
6. WHEN a player uses Diplomatic Retreat THEN the system SHALL allow safe withdrawal of a piece from danger
7. WHEN a player uses Blitzkrieg THEN the system SHALL allow two attacks in one turn
8. WHEN a player uses Trade Negotiations THEN the system SHALL provide temporary shield protection for key pieces
9. WHEN a player uses Missile Strike THEN the system SHALL remove an opponent's pawn from the board

### Requirement 2: Game State Management with Django Models

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Django models for game state persistence, so that games can be saved, resumed, and tracked over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL persist game state using Django models
2. WHEN a player makes a move THEN the system SHALL save the move to the database with timestamp
3. WHEN a game is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from the last saved state
4. WHEN viewing game history THEN the system SHALL display all moves with timestamps
5. IF a game is completed THEN the system SHALL record the final result and statistics
6. WHEN querying active games THEN the system SHALL return only games in progress

### Requirement 3: User Authentication and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create an account and track my game statistics, so that I can monitor my progress and compete with other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits THEN the system SHALL provide registration functionality
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a profile with default statistics
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Django's built-in system
4. WHEN viewing profile THEN the system SHALL display wins, losses, draws, and preferred alliance
5. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL update both players' statistics
6. IF a user forgets password THEN the system SHALL provide password reset functionality

### Requirement 4: Enhanced AI with Alliance Abilities

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI to use alliance abilities strategically, so that single-player games are challenging and realistic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI evaluates moves THEN the system SHALL consider alliance abilities in decision making
2. WHEN AI has available abilities THEN the system SHALL use them at optimal moments
3. WHEN AI uses abilities THEN the system SHALL follow the same rules as human players
4. WHEN AI difficulty is set THEN the system SHALL adjust ability usage frequency accordingly
5. IF AI is losing THEN the system SHALL prioritize defensive abilities appropriately

### Requirement 5: Real-time Game Updates and Notifications

**User Story:** As a player, I want real-time updates during gameplay, so that I can see opponent moves and ability usage immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opponent makes a move THEN the system SHALL update the board in real-time
2. WHEN opponent uses an ability THEN the system SHALL display ability notification
3. WHEN it's my turn THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication
4. WHEN game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI elements
5. IF connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and sync state

### Requirement 6: Game Room and Matchmaking System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create or join game rooms, so that I can play with specific opponents or find random matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a room THEN the system SHALL generate a unique room code
2. WHEN joining with room code THEN the system SHALL connect players to the same game
3. WHEN searching for match THEN the system SHALL pair players with similar skill levels
4. WHEN room is full THEN the system SHALL start the game automatically
5. IF a player disconnects THEN the system SHALL pause the game and wait for reconnection
6. WHEN game ends THEN the system SHALL provide option to play again or return to lobby
